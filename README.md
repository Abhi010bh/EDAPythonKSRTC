# 🚌 Passenger Traffic Analysis in Bus Transport System 📊

## Problem Statement 🎯
The project "Passenger Traffic Analysis in Bus Transport System" aims to delve into the complexities of bus fleet management and analyze the passenger traffic dynamics within a transportation system. The primary objectives of this project are to uncover valuable insights, patterns, and correlations from a provided dataset and subsequently provide informed recommendations for optimizing the bus transportation system's efficiency.

## Objectives and Scope of the Project 🚀
### Objectives:
1. **Comprehensive Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing various facets of bus fleet management, such as fleet utilization, kilometers traveled, and off-road vehicles.
2. **Insight Generation:** Generate insights through data visualization and statistical analysis to offer a deeper understanding of the performance of the bus fleet across different cities.
3. **Efficiency Identification:** Identify areas where the transportation system can be made more efficient by analyzing factors like effective passenger density, schedule kilometers, and more.
4. **Correlation Assessment:** Assess correlations between different variables, such as fleet utilization and effective kilometers, to inform decision-making.

### Scope:
- **Data Exploration:** Explore the provided dataset, understand the variables, and identify any potential data quality issues.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, transforming data, and assigning unique identifiers to cities.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform visualizations like bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to uncover insights and correlations within the data.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics to provide an overview of the dataset's attributes.
- **Exponential Distribution Fitting:** Explore fitting an exponential distribution to a subset of the data and visualize the fit using a Probability Density Function (PDF) curve.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Assess the correlation between "EffPassDensity" and "Effective Kilometers (in lakh)" using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
- **Data Visualization:** Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visually appealing plots and charts that convey insights effectively.
